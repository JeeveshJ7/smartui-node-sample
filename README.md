* [Examples For Different Use Cases](#examples-for-different-use-cases)

## Pre-requisites

1. To get started, you would require the Node version >=14.
  ```
  node --version
  ```

2. You can switch the Node version by running the below command:

  ```

3. Install the Dependencies.
  ```
  npm i
  ```


## Examples For Different Use Cases

We have many different examples revolving around different use cases. They are as follows:

### General Capability Change Test Cases

   * `index.js` - This Test is an example of all the **advanced funtionalities** possible with Smart UI.
  
      ```
      npm start
      ```
   * `general.js` - This Test is an example of all the **general test**
   
        ```
        npm start general
        ```
       
   * `errorSetting.js` - This Test is an example of how **error settings** can be modified.
   
      ```
      npm start error
      ```
      
   * `transparency.js` - This Test is to show how to **alter the opacity** of the comparison screenshot.
   
      ```
      npm start transparency
      ```
      
   * `BoundingBoxes.js` - This Test shows an example of comparing only a **certain area** in the screenshot.
   
      ```
      npm start boundingBoxes
      ```
      
   * `ignoredBoxes.js` - This test is for **excluding certain areas** in the screenshot for comparison.
   
      ```
      npm start ignoredBoxes
      ```
      
   * `ignoreAreasColoredWith.js` - This test is for **removing the colored content** from the comparison.
   
      ```
      npm start ignoreAreasColoredWith
      ```
      
### Execute Tests on Multiple Resolutions

If you want to execute Visual Regression tests on multiple resolutions, you need to add the capability `resolution` in capabilities option.
```
  let capabilities = {
      ...
      resolution = "1920x1080";
      ...
  }
```
Few common resolutions are:
- 1024x768
- 1280x800
- 1600x1200
- 1920x1080
- 2560x1440

Here is the code for all the commonly used resolutions:

#### Run Test on `1024x768` resolution 
```
$ node custom-resolutions.js 1024x768
```

#### Run Test on `1280x800` resolution 
```
$ node custom-resolutions.js 1280x800
```

#### Run Test on `1600x1200` resolution 
```
$ node custom-resolutions.js 1600x1200
```


#### Run Test on `1920x1080` resolution 
```
$ node custom-resolutions.js 1920x1080
```


#### Run Test on `2560x1440` resolution 
```
$ node custom-resolutions.js 2560x1440
```
